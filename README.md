# Exploring_Mars_Web_Scraping_and_Data_Analysis_Expedition

Overview
The project focuses on web scraping and subsequent data analysis related to Mars. It comprises two main deliverables:

Paet 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
    1. Utilize automated browsing to access the Mars news site.
    2. Use Beautiful Soup to extract text elements from the website.
    3. Extract titles and preview text of the news articles, storing the data in Python dictionaries and lists.
    4. (Optional) Save the scraped data in a JSON file.
    
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
    1. Employ automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
    2. Use Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the HTML table and assemble it into a Pandas DataFrame.
    3. Analyze the dataset by answering specific questions using Pandas functions.
    4. Analyze the average minimum daily temperature and plot the result as bar chart.
    5. Analyze the number of terrestrial days and plot the daily minimum temperature.
    6. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
